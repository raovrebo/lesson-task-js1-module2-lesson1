# JavaScript 1 - Module 2

## Lesson Task 1 Questions

### Question 1

Create a function called `receivingFunction` which accepts one argument. Inside this function check if the argument is a function, and if it is, call the function.

Create another function called `callbackFunction` which logs the string: "I am a callback function".

Call `receivingFunction` and pass `callbackFunction` into it as an argument.

### Question 2

Convert the following `for` loop to a `forEach` loop.

```js
const prizes = ["Bag of bananas", "Box of frogs", "Car of clowns"];

for (let i = 0; i < prizes.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Prize ${i + 1}: ${prizes[i]}`);
}
```

### Question 3

Write code that waits 5 seconds before logging the string: `I waited 5 seconds before executing`. Store the amount of seconds (5 initially) in a variable so it can be easily changed.

### Question 4

Write code that logs the numbers 1 to 4 every 1.5 seconds and then stops.
